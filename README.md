# voxelia
A custom voxel-based game engine made in GoLang and Raylib

## WARNING:
This game engine is NOWHERE near ready.
In the current state, the only thing you'll see is a spinning green box, so, DON'T expect a full fledged Minecraft clone or whatever! (This isnt a Minecraft clone, to begin with!)

This game is also my FIRST GO PROGRAM EVER MADE. So it ~may be~ IS FILLED WITH FLAWS.

## Running instructions
In Posix/Linux/MacOSX:
```shell
go get -v github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go/raylib
git clone github.com/darltrash/voxelia
go run voxelia
```
